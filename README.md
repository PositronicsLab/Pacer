This repository hosts code for [Pacer] an open source robot locomotion library for simulation and physical robots.

[Pacer]: https://github.com/PositronicsLab/Pacer

## Installation/building

[Pacer] currently must be built from source. Debian binaries will be available soon.

In the project base directory:
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ccmake .. # configure cmake project
$ make all
```
Make sure that all Plugins and Interfaces build successfully

##Running Pacer (Example)

In the project base directory (bash terminal):
```
$ source setup.sh
$ cd $PACER_HOME/example/models/links
```
in Gazebo:
```
$ gazebo links.world
```
in Moby:
```
$ moby-driver -p=$PACER_HOME/build/example/interfaces/libPacerMobyPlugin.so model.xml
```
###Dependencies 

##Required 

- [Ravelin] 
- [Moby] 
- Boost 
- [CVars] 

##Optional 

- OpenSceneGraph
- [GLConsole] 
- [DXL]
- SDL (permits joystick control)

###Usage

Access the library by using the examples found in the examples directory:

 EXAMPLE       |  DESCRIPTION
--------------|---------------------------------------------------------
 interfaces     |  Moby & Gazebo controller plugins communicte with Pacer
 models        |  Pre-implemented robot models and vars files (see models/README.md)
 plugins   |    Discrete control modules for the robot.  Add capabilites to Pacer by adding plugins here.

## Exporting Data to MATLAB

 Logs are either output to terminal or written to the file: "out.log" in the run directory.  Running Pacer will overwrite the current instance of "./out.log"

 Vectors and Matrices output is readable in Matlab.  The examples in [scripts] demonstrate exporting output from Pacer's logs to MATLAB readable space delimited files.
